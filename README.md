# Dictionary-Classification
In this project, I attempt to distinguish between hard news (i.e. news focused on current events, politics, public affairs etc.) and soft news (i.e. news focused on lifestyle, entertainment, human interest stories etc.) using a simple dictionary method. I define two dictionaries, one for hard and one for soft news, in order to classify the articles in the dataset. The dictionaries are based on a brief qualitative immersion phase in which I identify some of the words that may identify soft vs. hard news. Then I use keyword expansion with word2vec to broaden their scope. The classification categories consist of 'soft news' meaning there were words from the soft word dictionary, 'hard news' meaning there were more words from the hard news dictionary, 'mixed' meaning there were equal words from both dictionaries and 'none' meaning there were no words from either dictionary. Upon inspecting the results it becomes clear that the method is ok for a simple rough classification, but not entirely accurate, especially considering that all articles should fall into only one category.
